## Context

We all need to be on the same page regarding what we think the website should generally look like. Our original team branding had a color palette that was very bold/startling and difficult to combine together fluidly. This meant that we ended up not using this color palette for our warmup activity. To prevent this from happening again, we thought it was best to purposefully revise the color palette we plan to use as a group before implementing it in designs. 

## Decision

We decided on the main components of the website being black and white (depending on light/dark mode) with colors for folders/tags (that users can select; orginally with blue (#90E0EF)).

## Consequences

We will have to figure out how to let users select colors for their folders and, later on, if we want the tags to be colored (and how that will interact with the colors of the folders using that tag). However, this should make our planning/wireframing and design process more straightforward.
