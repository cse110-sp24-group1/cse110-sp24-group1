# Use Jest Puppeteer for End-to-End Testing

## Status

## Context

We need a robust solution for end-to-end testing to ensure that our application's user flows work correctly across different environments and scenarios.

## Decision

We will use Jest Puppeteer, a combination of Jest and Puppeteer, for our end-to-end testing needs. Jest provides a simple and powerful testing framework, while Puppeteer allows us to control a headless Chrome browser, enabling us to simulate user interactions and test the application as a user would.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Jest Puppeteer offers a familiar testing environment for developers already using Jest.
  - Puppeteer's ability to interact with a headless browser allows for comprehensive testing of user flows and interactions.
  - Jest's built-in assertions and test runners streamline the testing process.
  - Our team is familiar with this technology.

- **Cons:**
  - Setting up and configuring Jest Puppeteer may require some initial effort.
  - End-to-end tests can be slower to run compared to unit tests, impacting development feedback loops.

- **Risks:**
  - As Puppeteer controls a real browser, tests may be affected by changes in the browser's behavior or environment.
  - Maintaining end-to-end tests can become challenging as the application evolves, potentially leading to flaky tests.

- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Cypress: Cypress provides a similar end-to-end testing experience but with a different approach and architecture. However, no one in our team was familiar with it which would have caused a learning curve.
