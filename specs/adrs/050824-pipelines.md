# API Usage

## Status

- [ ] Propose
- [X] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

This was originally placed as one of our "no-go" items, but after some group consideration on how we would implement the project, it seemed as though not using APIs would pose some additional difficulty.

## Decision

We can use APIs in the constructing of our final project. 

## Consequences

This should make general implementation of our website more simple. However, there is a potential for a disparity of knowledge to occur between team members that have worked with APIs more, and those that have not.
