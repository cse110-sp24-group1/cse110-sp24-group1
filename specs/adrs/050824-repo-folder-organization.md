# Repo Folder Organization

## Status

- [ ] Propose
- [X] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

It would be really easy for the organization in our repo to go awry, and we should try to plan against that while we can. As it is, our repo is already becoming a little difficult to sift through, simply because to how much is in it. 


## Decision

Folders under `frontend` will include `assets`, `scripts`, `html`, and `stylesheets`. Folders under `backend` will include `data` and `scripting`.

## Consequences

Hopefully this will supply better organization within our repository as our project forms, instead of the possible descent into chaos. All members simply have to maintain diligence toward carefully following the outlined folders.
