- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

The draggable component for dragging a note into a folder was causing issues with local storage management and was proving to be more complex and time-consuming to implement within the project timeline. Given the time constraints and the need to focus on higher-priority features, we decided to divert our attention elsewhere.

## Decision

We decided to remove the draggable component for moving notes into folders. Instead, users will create or move notes and folders by navigating into the desired folder and using the buttons provided within that folder.

## Consequences

- Simplified codebase by removing the complex draggable functionality.
- Reduced potential for bugs related to local storage management.
- Streamlined the user experience by using familiar button-based interactions within folders.
- Allowed the team to focus on more critical features and ensure timely project delivery.
