## Context

There is general uncertainty over which colors specifically should be used for the website, as well as questions regarding the formatting of elements. 

## Decision

The colors of our website depend on light/dark mode being activated, and the default blue color we selected is `#90E0EF`. For dark mode, the text color will be `#f0f6fc`, the background will be `#161b22`, buttons will be `#30363d`, or `#484f58` on hover, buttons will have border color `#f0f6fc`, and the nav bar will be `#21262d` with a shadow. The buttons on the nav bar are subject to change depending on what looks best, but they will likely be the default blue color or `#f0f6fc`. For light mode, the text color will be `#24292f`, the background will be `#f6f8fa`, buttons will be `#d0d7de`, or `#afb8c1` on hover, buttons will have border color `#24292f`, and the nav bar will be `#eaeef2` with a shadow. The buttons on the nav bar are subject to change depending on what looks best, but they will likely be the default blue color or `#24292f`.

All of our units will be in `em` or `rem`, and the margins of the Home Page and Task List should match. As for font size, we will keep it as default unless changes are necessary.

## Consequences

This will make the design implementation process on behalf of the frontend team more straightfoward and well-organized. All members simply have to refer to the guidelines agreed upon.
