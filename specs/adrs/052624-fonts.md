## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

- [ ] Propose
- [X] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

We did not previously establish a font to use across our project, and so we were using the default.

## Decision

We will be using one font for our entire project: Open Sans. Since we're only using one font, we will make use of the different styles of this font (bold/light/normal).

## Consequences

This should help make our website appear more finalized and consistent. It just has to be added to the style. However, we still have to consider when/where to use bold/light/normal as the font style of choice.
