## Status

## Context
What different workflows we can use that are fair and efficient.
## Decision

We decided to establish JSDocs to use for Github Actions as well as stricting Linting workflows that span across HTML/CSS/JS

## Consequences

Lots of times merge requests will be delayed a lot longer because we have to reformat the entire code to adhere to linting requirements for each PR.
