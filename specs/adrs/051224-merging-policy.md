# Merging Policy

## Status

- [ ] Propose
- [X] Accepted
- [ ] Rejected
- [ ] Deprecated
- [ ] Superseded

## Context

Main should be highly protected to avoid having unfinished code being distributed for people to work on.

## Decision

Two people must approve a merge request (one is a team lead and the other is from front/backend).

## Consequences

This is intended to keep main clear and to improve communication among the teams and leads. However, this will cause a delay in merging PRs, since each of them must be checked by two other people.
