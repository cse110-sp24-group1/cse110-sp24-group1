      - Fixed the styling of the documents on the home page, we also made the documents draggable
      - Created style guidelines
      - Added the dark mode theme 
      - (from wed-sun last week) Created Nav bar styling to be placed in and edited for the home screen / task bar files 
      - Worried about merging to main
      - Worked on the new note and exist note

  - Backend
      - Planning to store an array of objects (name, id, label)

- **Decisions:** 
    - Color of document should be from the category selection
    - When adding folder can only rename; don't need extended form
        - Use default color (the blue) 
        - No icon for folders (can't change colors then)
    - How to store folders within folders within... ?
        - Store one array of all folders 
        - Pull folders by their id 
    - Markdown API? Is that done? - push back, looks possible
    - Work on comunicating to minimize merge conflicts 
        - Notify others when editing a file, if someone else wants to edit, send your code to them
